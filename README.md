## Project 1: Compute Drone Path
This is a classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Given a list of points (X, Y) with no more than 256 elements, we need to develop an algorithm that starts and ends with the first point. The goal for this project is to minimize the travel distance that covers all points. 

## Project 2: Advanced Compute Drone Path
Build from Project 1: Instead of no more than 256 points in a particular area, there are more points given. From Project 1, we need to apply K-means, one of the popular ML algorithms, to minimize the total distance the drone travels.
